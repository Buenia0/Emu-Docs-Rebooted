Most emulators have a hack to force VGA reg 3c2h bit 4 to always be 1. This
breaks the RIVA 128 BIOS, which fills the screen with red and expects this
bit to eventually be 0. If it isn't, it beeps and hangs until it is. PCem
currently handles this with a hack that needs to be adjusted for this BIOS.

if ((svga->vgapal[0].r + svga->vgapal[0].g + svga->vgapal[0].b) >= 0x50)

To work for the RIVA 128 BIOS, it has to be 0x4e instead of 0x50.
