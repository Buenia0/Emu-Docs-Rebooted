First Revision - 5/16/2003

To Do:
Add information from Eidolon's document
Reverse engineer and add information about other modes
Add examples


-----------
|Registers|
-----------
All registers are word-wide and are accessible by the Sub CPU.

FF8058 - Mode?  All my tests involved a value of 7h.
FF805A - Name table offset in WordRAM shifted right 2 bits. (note, only the top 3 bits are used)
FF805C - Output height in cells
FF805E - Offset in WordRAM to store output shifted right 2 bits.
FF8060 - Unkown, Sonic CD intro sets this to 0
FF8062 - Output Width in pixels
FF8064 - Number of output lines to process (note, this does not effect the number of cells output by the chip)
FF8066 - Offset in WordRAM of Line Definition Table shifted right 2 bits.

----------
|Patterns|
----------
These are garden variety Genesis paterns, except that they are grouped in 4x4 blocks.

------------
|Name Table|
------------
The name table defines how the patterns will be mapped onto a virtual 4096x4096 image.  Each entry is 2 bytes long and gives the offset into WordRAM of the 16 cell block to use.  The value is shifted 7 bits to the right.  The name table is 8000h bytes in size.

-----------------------
|Line Definition Table|
-----------------------
This table has an entry for every output line.  Each entry consists of the following

0x0:	X Coordinate
0x2:	Y Coordinate
0x4:	X Component of the distance
0x6:	Y Component of hte distance

This information defines a line on the virtual 4096x4096 image.  Pixel data is taken from along this line to produce the output line.  The coordinate plane has a greater resolution than the virtual image defined by the name table.  8 units on the coordinate plane are equal to one pixel.

--------
|Output|
--------
The chip outputs patterns in the standard Genesis format; however, it goes down the column before it goes down the row.  Set up your name table on the Genesis VDP accordingly.


Notes: Some or all of this data probably only applies to the mode I tested.  None of this information has been thoroughly tested and none of it has been tested on the real hardware (because I'm lazy and out of CD-Rs).

I would like the thank the following people in no particular order, Eidolon, Steve Snake, Stephane Dallongeville, and all the contributors to Eidolon's Sega CD document.
